\chapter{Summary}
"WatchWithFriends" is an innovative social platform designed to facilitate and enhance the experience of watching videos together. In my thesis, I thoroughly analyzed and described the process of building such an application, including the development of technological infrastructure and the optimization of user interactions.
Additionally, the thesis extensively addresses the communication mechanisms between client and server, as well as the data exchange processes between the server and databases. I focused particularly on demonstrating the operation of frontend and backend components. In the backend, I discussed the coordinated operation and testability of repositories, services, and controllers. In the frontend aspect, I introduced the component-based development methodology and its benefits, which are crucial for the effective implementation of modern web applications.
Moreover, I detailed the application's building and deployment processes. During the build phase, I placed particular emphasis on the use of Docker technology, which facilitates the application's operation in a containerized environment and its scalability. In the deployment phase, I utilized the Drone CI/CD tool, which enables automated continuous integration and delivery, ensuring seamless and rapid updates of the application across various development and operational environments.
